# source reconstruction

**Local agent: start with [LOCAL_AGENT_HANDOFF.md](LOCAL_AGENT_HANDOFF.md).** It includes the current Test 5 diagnosis, device retest, exact build layout, open issues, emulator failure evidence, and a verified workspace-preparation helper. For the independent native-source route, read [RECONSTRUCTION-HANDOFF.md](RECONSTRUCTION-HANDOFF.md).

## Engine source reconstruction — mesh and animation checkpoint

[Browse the mesh/animation C++ module](port/asset-payloads/README.md) and [verified binary layouts](port/asset-payloads/FORMATS.md). The loader decodes all 10,924 type-0 meshes and 890,301 animation time keys in the recovered BRES cache, including the Prince model's deferred buffers. Twenty-six complete animation accessor/search bodies pass [271,970 original-ARM32/compiled-ARM64 comparisons](reports/asset-payloads-arm-validation.json) with zero mismatches; all 456 original instruction addresses were exercised. Separate target checks pass 25,682 comparisons on 1,149 meshes. Host/ARM64 builds and 5,000 sanitizer probes pass. [OBJ and animation JSON examples](port/asset-payloads/examples/README.md) are included. Nine type-1 geometries, scene/controller and material/image decoding, GPU ownership, rendering and gameplay remain unfinished. This checkpoint is published directly on GitHub.

## Engine source reconstruction — resource checkpoint

[Browse the resource-loading C++ module](port/engine-resources/README.md). This adds 35 complete reader/Collada-accessor bodies and the whole-buffer BRES relocation branch, reconstructed from original ARM instructions and compiled for ARM64. [Validation](reports/engine-resources-validation.json) passed 10,449 reader comparisons and every fixup in all 2,901 recovered BRES images: 2,577,206 fixups, with zero mismatches. The port exposes top-level animation/image/material/geometry tables using native pointers while preserving the serialized 32-bit offsets. The subsequent payload checkpoint above adds mesh/raw-animation decoding; image/material decoding, rendering and gameplay remain unfinished. This checkpoint is published directly on GitHub; the existing Drive ZIP remains the earlier math checkpoint.

## Engine source reconstruction — math checkpoint

[Browse the reconstructed C++ module](port/engine-math/README.md). Twenty original vector/quaternion/matrix function starts have been rewritten from ARM assembly and compile for ARM64. The [recorded test report](reports/engine-math-validation.json) contains 21,477 original-ARM32 versus compiled-ARM64 comparisons with zero mismatches, under the documented external arithmetic/libm model. All 1,704 original instruction addresses in these routines were exercised. This is a tested engine component; asset loading, rendering and gameplay reconstruction remain unfinished. The full source ZIP and validation-artifact ZIP in the Drive folder below now include this checkpoint.

## Fold7 compatibility build — test 5

[Download the Test 5 APK and complete work archive](https://github.com/Noamcelermajer/DH_sc/releases/tag/v1.0.2-fold7-test5). The Test 4 phone report confirms its directory guard ran, followed by a new failure reopening the prince character model with a duplicated cache root. An original-engine probe reproduces the bad absolute-path classification. Test 5 changes five ARM instructions to recognize Android absolute paths and records model-open results.

Thirteen path cases, five earlier file cases, native library/hook checks and APK/signature checks pass. **Loading and gameplay still need a Fold7 retest.** Install over Test 4, keep the same options and cache, repeat the load, then export DH2-test5-diagnostics.zip. Russian menus, display behavior and the earlier GL error remain unresolved or unverified.

Read [TEST5.md](compatibility/work/fold7-build/TEST5.md) for the diagnosis, assembly, test limits and device procedure. Test 5 modifies the engine binary; earlier byte-identical-engine statements refer to Tests 1–4.

The complete Test 5 compatibility snapshot is preserved in `compatibility-work-test5.zip`. Prepare a new work directory with current Git source overlaid on that verified snapshot:

```sh
python3 tools/prepare_local_agent.py ../DH2-local-work
```

The helper verifies the archive and runtime inputs, restores the original-library layout expected by the patchers, and leaves the checkout unchanged. The destination must not exist. `unpack_compatibility.py` remains the exact historical restorer; see the handoff before using it with newer files.

Authored source and reports are browsable under `compatibility/`; the standard full-directory ZIP is attached to the release. Previous releases and independent engine reconstruction are retained. External toolchains and duplicate intermediates are represented by versions, hashes and instructions. Original rights and third-party notices apply.

**Download the complete recovery handoff:** [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1njTxLAJHt08SinEskn7gC6IWylXemwDW). The folder contains the source ZIP, full native assembly/symbol bundles, validation artifacts, the exact supplied APK and all ten supplied cache parts. Start with START-HERE.txt. This GitHub repository contains the engine math/resource/payload checkpoints and compatibility work. The remaining recovery paths below refer to the downloaded source package.

This repository contains code recovered from the supplied **Dungeon Hunter 2 HD v1.0.2 Android APK**, binary evidence for its native engine, recovered level configurations and shaders, and independently reconstructed port components. Its purpose is a reviewable studio handoff and a starting point for restoring the game on modern Android.

**This is not the original studio source repository or a completed, playable ARM64 port.** Native decompiler output is pseudocode that still requires reconstruction and behavioral validation. A successful export or compilation is not evidence that the game runs.

Large assembly and ELF inventories are included as compressed bundles to keep the repository manageable. No evidence is dropped by this packaging. After cloning, restore their individual files with:

```sh
python tools/unpack_native.py
```

This recreates `recovered/native/assembly/` and `recovered/native/symbols/`, including all original function aliases and raw bytes outside named functions. Decompiler output, Java, smali, recovered configuration and shader files are available directly in the repository.

## Findings that change the restoration plan

1. **The main engine is not stripped.** Its symbol tables preserve gameplay and engine names, virtual tables, relocations, 867 build-source filenames and ARM/Thumb mapping symbols. Assembly recovery round-trips all executable bytes across the three libraries: **6,488,258 bytes**. This is strong binary evidence; it is not C++ source recovery or a runtime test.
2. **DWARF does not contain the gameplay implementation.** All 32 identified compilation units cover licensing/online glue (7), STLport (22) or libgcc (3). The debugging metadata is useful for these components, but cannot substitute for reconstructing the engine's gameplay classes.
3. **The cache upload is incomplete.** The ten parts total exactly 314,572,800 bytes and stop inside `data/sounds/m_world_map.wav`. At least 368,651 compressed bytes are missing to complete that entry, followed by an unknown amount of remaining archive data. The ZIP central directory is absent. Files reported as recovered passed decompressed-length and CRC-32 checks; the incomplete file is excluded.
4. **A considerable amount of game data is already readable.** Most module/game-object formats are XML, and the shader package contains original GLSL text. Binary resources include BRES `.bdae`, BTEX/PVR texture wrappers, WAV and VoxN audio. Three original XML files contain duplicate attributes; they are preserved unchanged and documented for parser compatibility.
5. **The supplied APK's provenance is not established as an untouched studio release.** Its manifest has compile-SDK 33 metadata and its DEX contains save-restoration/additional support classes. The repository faithfully documents this supplied binary. Those observations do not establish who repackaged it or what changes were made.
6. **Rebuilding for ARM64 is a separate engineering project.** The three supplied native libraries are ELF32 ARM. Renaming ABI folders, changing target SDK, or compiling the small JNI library cannot turn the engine into a native ARM64 game. Class layouts, pointers, JNI/reflection names, graphics, storage, audio, networking and gameplay must be validated together.

See [`docs/FINDINGS.md`](docs/FINDINGS.md) for evidence interpretation and [`docs/PORTING.md`](docs/PORTING.md) for the remaining work.

## Start reviewing

- The exact input APK SHA-256 is `32c2d027b585a42547311cd95da6a3975fdb3174e663e513d42a7f49d1a4c200`.
- Read [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) for generated coverage and test results.
- For behavior, prefer exact smali/assembly over a decompiler's inferred types or control flow. A `.pseudo.c` file deliberately does not claim to compile.
- Inspect [`port/engine-math/README.md`](port/engine-math/README.md) for the math module, original-address mapping and differential-test limits. Floating-point helper metadata incorrectly truncates 16 of 19 vector/quaternion pseudocode bodies; their assembly remains complete.
- Inspect [`port/engine-resources/README.md`](port/engine-resources/README.md) for memory/subfile readers, checked BRES offset loading, Collada table layouts and original-instruction checks. The next payload checkpoint adds mesh and raw animation decoding; image/material decoding and rendering remain unfinished.
- Inspect [`port/asset-payloads/README.md`](port/asset-payloads/README.md) for checked mesh/deferred-buffer decoding, raw animation keys, original keyframe timing/search and small real exports. Its format tables and reports distinguish complete animation functions from partial GPU/ownership evidence.
- Inspect [`port/nativeinterface/README.md`](port/nativeinterface/README.md) for the buildable native component, its differential tests, and documented safe differences from undefined behavior in the original.
- Give the rights holder this repository together with the exact input APK and complete original cache when available. Ask for original engine/build metadata and asset tooling; source-file names and subsystem inventories help focus that search.

The independent reconstruction modules use owner-supplied inputs. The compatibility snapshot is an explicit exception to their earlier packaging policy: it includes original `.so` inputs, the tested runtime bundle, and a deliberately public development signing-key fixture. Complete art/audio cache archives and external SDK/NDK/JDK/emulator toolchains are not included. The local-agent handoff identifies which older recovery-package paths are absent from this checkout. Recovered materials carry their original provenance; this repository does not assert an open-source license for the game. See [`RIGHTS.md`](RIGHTS.md).
