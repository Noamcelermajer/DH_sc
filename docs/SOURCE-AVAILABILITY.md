# Source availability and restoration inventory

This inventory distinguishes source that can be browsed in Git from source-like evidence stored in archives or supplied separately. The baseline counts below describe commit `15dafc0` (2026-10-02). The current branch also includes a selected recovery-source import described below. See [RIGHTS.md](../RIGHTS.md) for provenance.

## In the Git checkout

The full-cache script import adds 219 **actual plaintext Lua source files**
(900,493 exact bytes) under `recovered/scripts/original/`, with archive-member
hashes and a verifier. They retain `.luac` filenames and original byte encodings.
218 originals pass Lua 5.1.5 syntax; one sandworm error is repaired in a separate
override under `port/lua-scripts/`. These are cache source, distinct from generated
native pseudocode. Script execution and native bridge integration remain open.
See [the script inventory](../recovered/scripts/README.md).

At the audited baseline, Git tracks **309 paths**: 225 under `compatibility/`, 55 under `port/`, 13 under `reports/`, and the remaining documentation, tools and four root-level snapshot ZIPs. The directly browsable independent C++ components now include `port/engine-math/`, `port/engine-resources/`, `port/asset-payloads/`, `port/texture-assets/`, `port/material-bindings/`, `port/scene-payloads/`, `port/scene-draw/`, `port/skin-payloads/`, `port/animation-values/`, `port/animation-pose/`, `port/animation-timeline/`, `port/animation-mixing/`, `port/animation-layers/`, `port/animation-transition/`, `port/animation-motion/`, `port/animation-completion/` and `port/animation-ending/`. The source Android app is under `port/android-app/`; it builds ARM64 and x86_64 libraries and previews imported scenes and character poses on Android 17. Their READMEs and test reports specify which isolated behavior was reconstructed and checked. The compatibility tree contains authored wrapper, patch, test and selected Java/C/C++ sources. It is a development wrapper around the original ARM32 engine, not a source replacement for that engine.

At that baseline, `recovered/`, `port/nativeinterface/`, `port/android-java/`, `tools/unpack_native.py` and `docs/REPRODUCING.md` were absent. A later selected source import added the browsable repaired Java/JNI source, recovery scripts, reproduction guide and a checksum manifest at `recovered/native/bundles/manifest.json`. Subsequent exact imports added raw Java/smali, native pseudocode/index exports, generated assembly/symbol text, shader/configuration resources and native debug exports described below. The compressed native bundle archives and original APK/cache files remain outside Git.

## Verified recovery-source import on this branch

The linked historical Drive source ZIP was retrieved and passed SHA-256 and full ZIP CRC checks: 17,036,838 compressed bytes, 3,388 members, 79,687,588 uncompressed bytes, SHA-256 `b3ff974e2b74f50387465d5665f60d56ac79c29a449c6299745461998045c4d8`. Its two separate bundle hashes also matched the handoff manifest. `tools/unpack_native.py` restored 3,625 assembly and 71 symbol evidence files; exact copies of those text files are now in Git. `tools/verify_recovery.py` rechecked every named function start and export shard, 2,164 recovered text/shader files and 288 repaired Java source files.

Selected files were imported as ordinary Git paths: 288 repaired Java sources in [`port/android-java`](../port/android-java/README.md), the 14-file reconstructed [`port/nativeinterface`](../port/nativeinterface/README.md) component, authored recovery/build tools and the required source hashes and reports. The [import ledger](RECOVERY-SOURCE-IMPORT.md) records each source and local SHA-256. Run `python tools/verify_recovery_import.py` to check the files in a clone; pass `--archive` with the downloaded ZIP to check provenance against the exact handoff. These are reconstructed/decompiled materials, not original studio source or a completed game.

## Archived code made browsable on this branch

The same verified recovery ZIP now supplies 765 additional code-export files as exact ordinary Git blobs: 44 [native Ghidra pseudocode/index/summary files](../recovered/native/decompiled/README.md) totaling 50,247,939 bytes, and 721 [raw JADX Java and APKTool smali files](../recovered/android/README.md) totaling 5,430,112 bytes. The native shards record 31,794 engine, 3,332 Storm and 31 JNI successful decompiler outputs, plus one failed engine and one failed Storm export. Those counts describe generated text, not correct compilable functions. The raw Java tree overlaps the repaired 288-source tree; its README records the exact overlap.

The two checksum-verified native bundles supply another 3,696 exact ordinary Git files: 3,625 [ARM/Thumb assembly text files and 71 symbol/index records](../recovered/native/README.md), totaling 301,508,790 bytes. A [per-file manifest](../recovered/native/evidence-manifest.json) and `tools/verify_native_evidence_import.py` verify checkout bytes and optionally compare every file to the pinned compressed bundles. These are generated records of the original binaries, not original studio source or buildable C/C++.

A subsequent [text and debug import](RECOVERED-TEXT-AND-DEBUG.md) adds 2,214 exact recovery ZIP members (21,618,099 bytes): 2,164 recovered shader/configuration resources, their historical provenance/cache accounting, and 48 native debug export files. The DWARF metadata covers license/online glue and C++/compiler runtime; it provides no original gameplay function bodies. Run `python tools/verify_remaining_recovery_import.py`, optionally with `--archive`, to verify the full import and original resource provenance.

Every imported file has a length and SHA-256 in its own manifest. `python tools/verify_native_decomp_import.py` and `python tools/verify_android_raw_import.py` verify a checkout; each accepts `--archive` to check exact ZIP members, archive hash and member CRCs. Git attributes disable line-ending conversion for the archival bytes. The generated code is preserved for inspection and future reconstruction, not represented as a source-built game or a game-wide open-source license.

## Tracked compatibility snapshots

The repository tracks `compatibility-work-test2.zip` through `compatibility-work-test5.zip`. They are content-addressed snapshots rather than ordinary source directories. Test 5's 16,454,234-byte ZIP has a manifest for **2,195 logical files** stored as **1,194 deduplicated blobs** plus the manifest. Its logical paths include 357 decompiled Java files (about 1.72 MB of text), original and patched smali trees, original ARM32 libraries, compatibility build inputs and test evidence. The Java is decompiler output; the snapshot does not contain the full native engine pseudocode and assembly recovery described below.

To restore Test 5 into a new sibling directory, from the repository root run:

```sh
python tools/prepare_local_agent.py ../DH2-local-work
```

The destination must not exist and must be outside the checkout. The helper verifies the pinned snapshot hash and each restored file, overlays current tracked compatibility sources, restores the original-library layout expected by the patch tools and checks the bundled runtime. It does not build or run the game. See [LOCAL_AGENT_HANDOFF.md](../LOCAL_AGENT_HANDOFF.md) for the build and test context.

## Separate owner-supplied inputs and older recovery package

The locally supplied original APK (`Dungeon-Hunter-2-HD-v1-0-2.apk`, SHA-256 `32c2d027b585a42547311cd95da6a3975fdb3174e663e513d42a7f49d1a4c200`) and complete cache ZIP (`Dungeon-Hunter-2-HD-v1-0-2-cache (1).zip`, SHA-256 `3fdf4e4c21d45a780a7c35fb4042abde0e88e76bf75416aad1f227481560b679`) are separate local inputs, not tracked files. The cache contains 6,833 CRC-checked files; see [the cache audit](COMPLETE-CACHE.md).

[The earlier recovery handoff](../RECONSTRUCTION-HANDOFF.md) describes a separate [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1njTxLAJHt08SinEskn7gC6IWylXemwDW) containing `Dungeon-Hunter-2-Source-Recovery.zip`, `assembly.tar.gz`, `symbols.tar.gz`, `Component-Validation-Artifacts.zip` and checksums. It was published through the engine-math checkpoint; later resource, payload, texture, material and scene modules are in Git. The ZIP and compressed bundles were retrieved and verified locally, but remain outside Git. Exact copies of native assembly/symbol exports, raw code exports, shader/configuration resources and native debug metadata are now in Git. The native debug JSONL records retain their archived gzip encoding.

The available pseudocode and decompiled Java are reverse-engineered evidence, not original studio source. The isolated reconstructed modules, including the checked scene reader, and compatibility wrapper do not yet form a buildable, playable full game from source. [RIGHTS.md](../RIGHTS.md) records provenance and does **not** grant a game-wide open-source license.
