# Android 17 and 16 KiB page support

This is a source audit for the standalone ARM64 compatibility app, not a device acceptance result. The published DH2 wrapper checks `Os.sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)` in `compatibility/work/fold7-build/java/com/zettabridge/launcher/Dh2Activity.java` and refuses to launch the guest unless it is 4096. The separate experimental mapper and strict private-anonymous discard patch passed focused tests and moved a player in one saved 3D level on a 16384-byte emulator; they have not passed the full translator and game acceptance checks. Keep the normal wrapper's guard until that work is complete.

Android version and kernel page size are separate test dimensions. An Android 17 image with `adb shell getconf PAGE_SIZE` reporting 4096 can exercise Android 17 behavior with the current runtime. It cannot establish 16 KiB support. Conversely, a 16 KiB Android image is necessary to validate the memory redesign. The x86_64 emulator image is useful for platform checks, but it does not by itself validate the production ARM64 translator library and its translated ARM32 execution path.

## Evidence from the pinned translator

The source inspected was public ZettaBridge commit `7c647a4f1ea150eab7978ab0da28fdf49f3a79de`, the base recorded in `compatibility/BUILDING.md`. The repository carries a DH2 patch and selected modified files rather than the complete pinned translator tree. The observations below refer to that pinned upstream source, with the DH2 patch checked for page-size changes.

| Boundary | Current implementation | 16 KiB host consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guest ABI | `core/include/zb/guest_memory.h` defines `kPageSize = 4096`; `core/src/process.cpp` supplies `AT_PAGESZ = kPageSize`; `core/src/syscalls.cpp` interprets `mmap2` offsets in 4096-byte units. | The ARM32 guest must retain its 4 KiB ABI and page table. Replacing this constant with 16384 would change guest-visible behavior and file offsets. |
| Backing mappings | `core/src/guest_memory.cpp` reserves 4 GiB, then uses `mmap(MAP_FIXED)` for each guest mapping, including a direct file `mmap` with the guest offset. | A 4 KiB-aligned guest address or offset is not necessarily aligned to the host's 16 KiB page. A coarse remap can also replace a neighboring live 4 KiB guest page. |
| Protection and unmap | The same file calls `mprotect` and replaces unmapped ranges with `MAP_FIXED` anonymous `PROT_NONE` mappings at guest granularity. `core/src/syscalls.cpp` also forwards `madvise` and `msync` against the direct guest base. | Host protection and unmapping cannot independently represent four guest pages inside one host page. Rounded calls could alter live neighbors; unrounded calls can fail. |
| Executed memory | `core/src/guest_thread.cpp` sets Dynarmic's `fastmem_pointer` to the direct guest base. Its slower memory callbacks check the guest page flags. | Merely keeping 4 KiB flag bytes while broadening host mappings would let direct translated loads/stores bypass per-guest-page permissions. |
| Host bridges | `host_ptr` checks guest flags for many JNI, GL, syscall, and asset accesses, while several paths access `memory().base()` directly after their own checks. | Any new backing strategy must audit direct pointers, mapped buffer lifetimes, and host calls that assume a contiguous guest byte range. |

The DH2 patch (`compatibility/work/fold7-build/zettabridge-dh2.patch`) has no guest-memory page-size redesign. The 16 KiB `PT_LOAD` alignment already reported for host ELF files solves a different requirement: loading the ARM64 library. It does not change guest mapping behavior. Android's [16 KiB page guidance](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes) separately calls out code using 4096 and page-aligned `mmap` arguments; its package backcompat mode is not evidence that this translator's explicit mappings work.

An isolated mapper prototype, strict discard patch, 35-check component test, and private Android 17 runtime trial are in [`compatibility/16k-port`](../compatibility/16k-port/README.md). They do not validate the full ARM64 JIT, host bridges, complete file-mapping semantics, or broad gameplay.

## Required design and proof

1. Preserve the ARM32 4 KiB guest ABI (`AT_PAGESZ`, `mmap2` units, address checks, and the per-4 KiB metadata). Detect the host page size separately at runtime.
2. Introduce a host-granule backing layer that owns complete 16 KiB chunks without replacing a chunk when one of its four guest subpages is mapped, protected, or unmapped. Zero newly mapped anonymous guest subpages and preserve live neighbors' bytes.
3. Represent 4 KiB-aligned file mappings whose address or offset does not meet host alignment. Preserve private copy-on-write behavior and either implement shared mapping/writeback accurately or reject unsupported shared cases explicitly. Audit `mremap`, `madvise`, and `msync` against that representation.
4. Make translated loads, stores, instruction fetches, and exclusive accesses honor guest flags at 4 KiB granularity. A conservative starting point is to disable direct Dynarmic fastmem on 16 KiB hosts and use the checked callbacks, then measure performance. Re-enable fastmem only with equivalent fine-grained checks or another proven fault scheme.
5. Audit `memory().base()` and `host_ptr` users, especially JNI array and direct-buffer exposure, GL client arrays, and host syscalls. Ensure a host pointer never outlives a mapping change and cannot silently access an unmapped guest subpage.
6. Add tests on an actual 16 KiB kernel: two different mappings sharing one host page; protect or unmap only one guest subpage; a file map at a 4 KiB but not 16 KiB offset; private writes and shared-write handling; cross-subpage read/write/fetch; JIT fault address and signal delivery; multi-threaded mapping changes; ARM32 linker/libc startup; full game startup and save/load. Run the existing 4 KiB suite too.

These are linked correctness changes across the mapper, syscall layer, and JIT memory path. There is no safe wrapper-only or one-line runtime change that unlocks 16 KiB execution. The launch guard should be removed only after the new tests pass on a 16 KiB Android system and the standalone ARM64 build passes native library and APK alignment checks.
