# Work required for a playable modern Android port

The current development target is Android 17 in official emulators; no Fold7 or other physical device was tested for this update. The owner's earlier Fold7 / One UI 8.5 target remains historical context. The supplied engine is ARM32. A complete native ARM64 restoration still requires the engine and its dependencies to be rebuilt from validated source, or a separately validated runtime translation approach. This repository concentrates on source recovery and evidence for reconstruction.

| Workstream | Evidence available | Required result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine class reconstruction | Named methods, vtables, relocation targets, disassembly, pseudocode and original build filenames | Valid C++ declarations/layouts and implementations with behavioral tests, including indirect calls and lifetime rules |
| Engine algorithms | Address-indexed function bodies and exact instruction bytes | Subsystem implementations checked against original ARM32 execution or controlled gameplay captures |
| C++ runtime | STLport/debug types, libgcc records and import inventory | Consistent modern compiler/STL ownership, allocation, exception and ABI rules |
| JNI and reflection | 46 DEX declarations; native imports/exports and call sites | Exact Java member-name contracts, pointer-safe native handles, thread attachment and exception handling |
| Rendering | Native symbols/imports, shader source and binary mesh/texture signatures | Tested graphics initialization, texture/mesh loaders, shaders, surfaces, resize/suspend and GPU behavior |
| Asset pipeline | XML configurations; BRES/BTEX/PVR evidence and original file hashes | Complete cache, decoded resource schemas, format readers and reproduced scene behavior |
| Storage | Original paths and level/resource references | Storage-picker import, consistent app-owned paths, reliable startup without obsolete downloads |
| Audio | WAV/VoxN signatures and native/audio call evidence | Format decoding, playback, suspend/resume and correct resource lifetime |
| Network/vendor services | Java billing/licensing layers and Storm symbols | Studio-approved replacement or restoration of unavailable endpoints without silently changing gameplay contracts |
| Packaging | Compilable isolated JNI source and Android SDK/NDK reproduction steps | Fully rebuilt ARM64 engine/support libraries, current Android lifecycle and installation, tested save handling |
| Game validation | Exact original binary and reproducible recovered evidence | Launch/menu/new-game/loading/combat/quests/save/load tests on device, followed by extended gameplay |

## Suggested reconstruction order

Binary-specific obstacles: the engine imports old Bionic globals (`__sF`, `_ctype_`, `_tolower_tab_`, `_toupper_tab_`), `libstdc++` and ARM `__aeabi` helpers. Modern source should use public libc APIs and a consistent current C++ toolchain. Its graphics calls include GLES2 shader/VBO/FBO operations despite a GLES1 dependency string. Storm contains `HookArm`/`HookThumb`/HookZz and shader-optimizer/Mesa symbols, with `mprotect`, `cacheflush` and dynamic symbol imports. Isolate the ARM-specific patching layer before porting it; this is distinct from gameplay reconstruction.

1. Retain the now-complete supplied cache and exact APK with their hashes; seek the cleanest available original APK from the rights holder. Compare supplied save-restoration additions before deciding which behaviors belong in a studio build.
2. Use the original source-file/symbol index to ask for archived engine headers, SDK projects, export tools, shader build pipelines and resource schemas. Even incomplete headers or tools can remove substantial uncertainty.
3. Build a controlled original ARM32 execution/reference environment for routine-level and gameplay traces. Static inspection alone cannot validate an entire game.
4. Audit every JNI/reflection member name and restore the Java/native contract. Compilation repairs may change names or expose existing bytecode/decompiler ambiguities.
5. Reconstruct foundational engine types and their ownership/layout rules, then isolate resource loading, rendering, scene graph, input, audio and game-state systems. Validate each against the original before migrating callers.
6. Replace address-sized assumptions with reviewed handles/types and rebuild all native components under one ARM64 toolchain. Do not preserve ARM32 object layouts by blindly widening fields.
7. Integrate app-owned cache import and Android lifecycle handling. Test permissions, surface loss, suspend/resume, audio interruption and saves on current Android emulators; test device-specific display behavior if a physical target is requested later.
8. Run actual gameplay validation before labeling the result a restored game or offering it as a release build.

The current workspace supplies a substantial recovery base, reconstructed native support, engine math covering 20 original function starts, and resource loading covering 35 complete bodies plus the whole-buffer BRES initializer branch. Math passed 21,477 original-ARM32/compiled-ARM64 comparisons. Resources passed 10,449 reader comparisons and every fixup in all 2,901 recovered BRES images. The resource component preserves four-byte serialized offsets and resolves separate native pointers instead of widening fields in place.

`port/asset-payloads` now adds interleaved type-0 mesh decoding, deferred buffers contained in complete files, raw animation keys and original typed keyframe search. The full-cache audit covers 10,924 meshes and 890,301 time keys; 26 complete animation bodies pass 271,970 original-ARM32/compiled-ARM64 comparisons. A separate reader checks the embedded mesh bytes in all nine type-1 geometry records, but their opaque prefix and spline semantics remain unresolved; the normal mesh API preserves the original runtime's rejection of type 1. Local-space OBJ and raw animation JSON export are available, and 1,149 meshes also pass host-versus-executed-ARM64 decoding checks.

Checked image/material views, static scene traversal, a host WebGL preview and a source-built Android candle renderer now exist. Checked software skinning and absolute character-pose previews now exist. The original range timeline is integrated into the Android preview, and a separate instruction-checked mixing module covers original weighted sums, normalization and quaternion addition. Diagnostic absolute layers now combine two imported animations on Android 17. The next engine work is the original animator target compiler, relative application, transitions/events, character/game state and ownership across loading and rendering. Bulk allocation and external/split-file loading also require reconstruction. One textured primitive is not complete game rendering or gameplay; these components do not provide a completed engine replacement, playable source-built APK or original studio C++ project. The separately tested Android 17 gameplay APK still runs the original ARM32 engine through a compatibility translator.
