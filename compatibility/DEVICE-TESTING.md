> Test 2 update: the device report confirms 4096-byte pages and native library/JNI startup. A MediaStore query crash was identified and repaired; the repaired APK awaits a device retest. See [TEST2](work/fold7-build/TEST2.md). The initial test 1 evidence below is retained historically.

## Current checkpoint: test 5

Test 4's device report confirms its directory guard ran, then shows a different failure while reopening the prince model: the cache root is duplicated. The original engine treats Android absolute paths as relative whenever WorkingDirectory is nonempty. A 20-byte ARM fix adds POSIX absolute-path recognition while retaining relative and colon-path behavior. The actual original/fixed engine tests confirm the failed open and correct byte reads after repair.

Thirteen path cases pass, as do five earlier file cases, native library/hook checks and final APK validation. The final model-open logging also passes two focused path probes. This is a new test APK; loading and gameplay on the device remain unverified. Russian menus, display behavior, the earlier GL error and 16 KB pages are still open. See [TEST5.md](work/fold7-build/TEST5.md).

Download Test 5. Install over Test 4, keep the same settings and existing cache, repeat the load, then export DH2-test5-diagnostics.zip. Test 5 modifies the engine binary itself; earlier statements that the engine is unchanged are historical.

## Historical checkpoint: test 4

Test 3 diagnostics identify the original engine's CFile filename bounds check. An independent original-ARM32 caller probe reproduces the same abort with a trailing directory path. Test 4 adds a narrow engine fopen guard and persistent STL error logging. All five file-opening regressions, native library/hook probes and APK checks pass. The observed path and loading-screen repair still require a device retest. See [TEST4.md](work/fold7-build/TEST4.md) and [BRIDGE-ASSESSMENT.md](work/fold7-build/BRIDGE-ASSESSMENT.md).

Download test 4. Install over Test 3, retain cache and saves, repeat the same load with the same options, then export diagnostics. Historical sections below remain for provenance.

## Historical checkpoint: test 3

Test 2 completes the cinematic and aborts at the subsequent fairy loading screen. Test 3 adds persistent native diagnostics and ZIP export, with optional language/display/context settings. The crash cause and gameplay stability remain unconfirmed. Read [TEST3.md](work/fold7-build/TEST3.md) for the exact changes and device procedure, and [BRIDGE-ASSESSMENT.md](work/fold7-build/BRIDGE-ASSESSMENT.md) for the independent compatibility assessment. Install test 3 over test 2 and export the diagnostic ZIP after reproducing the failure; retain the existing cache.

Download test 3. Older sections below preserve the earlier investigation.

# physical-device acceptance procedure

This is the remaining gate for the user-requested working app. No row below has a phone pass result yet.

Record phone model, One UI version, Android build/security patch, CPU ABIs, host page size, APK SHA-256, cache SHA-256/size, available storage, and whether the test uses the cover or inner screen. The setup app's diagnostic report supplies several of these.

| Order | Action | Expected result | Evidence to retain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Install APK without removing the original game | Separate test app appears and opens | Install error or setup screenshot |
| 2 | Wait for preparation and open diagnostics | Libraries prepare; page size is 4096 | Full diagnostic report |
| 3 | Import complete cache ZIP from Downloads | Import completes; destination is shown | Cache hash, file layout, import message |
| 4 | Tap Launch game | Game activity reaches its menu | Video/screenshot and logs on failure |
| 5 | Start a new game and enter a level | Correct textures, UI, lighting and character rendering | Screenshot of any missing/incorrect graphics |
| 6 | Exercise movement, combat, inventory and menus | Touch coordinates and UI actions are correct | Reproduction for dropped/misaligned input |
| 7 | Play with sound; change volume and background/resume | Music/effects work and recover | Audio symptom and lifecycle sequence |
| 8 | Save, exit, force-stop app, reopen and load | Progress/preferences persist | Before/after saved state |
| 9 | Switch between cover and inner screens, fold/unfold and rotate where allowed | Activity remains usable; surface and touch recover | Sequence and screen recording |
| 10 | Lock/unlock phone; switch apps; return after memory pressure | No crash or unrecoverable black screen | Diagnostic report and lifecycle details |
| 11 | Run at least 30 minutes and transition through multiple areas | Stable gameplay with no sustained stalls or memory failures | Duration, battery/thermal observations, last action |
| 12 | Test offline/online startup and intended legitimate service flows | Behavior is understood; obsolete-service failures are separated from local crashes | Endpoint/error information, without credentials |
| 13 | Exercise multiplayer only after single-player passes | Permissions and connection behavior are documented | Permission prompts and connection results |

If the app reports a non-4096 page size, record it and stop the gameplay acceptance run. The existing build cannot resolve that issue through cache placement.

If it crashes, reopen **View / share diagnostic report**. Include the first failing step, what appeared onscreen, and whether it happened before or after cache import. With ADB available, collect a time-bounded logcat around reproduction; review it for unrelated personal information before sharing publicly.

Completion means the required device cases pass with recorded evidence, plus fixes and reruns for any actual failures. The existing host tests cannot establish this result.
