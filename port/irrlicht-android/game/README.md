# SceneMesh to Irrlicht adapter slice

This isolated module adapts the repository's checked, flattened
`dh2::viewer::SceneMesh` and `SceneDrawDescriptor` records into the public
Irrlicht `SMesh` / `SMeshBuffer` APIs. It adds one mesh buffer per visible draw,
copies each draw's vertex positions and UVs, remaps its bounded 16-bit indices
to buffer-local indices, and computes approximate vertex normals from triangle
winding. Source vertex positions are already world transformed by the
`SceneMesh` assembly path; this adapter applies no further transform.

It does not open BRES files or source APK assets, extract source materials, map
materials automatically, create a texture manager, or modify the app renderer.
Callers can provide a `TextureResolver` to map the source descriptor and its
sampler records to an `ITexture`; that callback's texture must remain valid for
the lifetime of the driver's mesh use. The adapter puts the returned texture
into Irrlicht layer 0. Multiple DH2 samplers/effects, opacity, shader
parameters, UV transforms, original vertex normals, lighting, and transparency
semantics are not reconstructed here. Normals are estimated and lighting is
disabled by default. This output is a static mesh snapshot even when its input
was assembled from a selected source animation pose.

## Prince source actor adapter

`PrinceActor` is the renderer-neutral rig/skin adapter used by the local SWAMP
diagnostic. It loads four source `_default_warrior-mesh-skin` controllers,
resolves each primitive's semantic position/color/UV slots through that
primitive's own `attributes[0]`, `attributes[2]`, and `attributes[4]` mapping,
and checks the corresponding weight/vertex counts. It retains immutable source
positions and deforms each pose through the checked engine-skinning palette.
`prince_mesh_adapter.cpp` copies the mutable positions into Irrlicht
`SMeshBuffer`s and marks vertex streams dirty after updates.

`PrinceCharacterRuntime` composes the shared source `character::Coordinator`,
the authored AnimationBank/table, and two-slot `actor::BlendedPlayback`. It
verifies and loads 116 registered resources and 158 ordered registration
occurrences, resolves KnightPlayerBase properties, and routes touch input
through recovered Idle/Move state updates. Registered assets with no serialized
animation payload remain registered without fabricated timing. SceneBinding
applies owner, helper, authored graph and root-displacement composition once;
the Irrlicht node stays at identity. The SWAMP floor-checked point movement
remains an explicit development producer. External Character/AI callbacks,
native physics, combat, and full game orchestration remain outside this slice.

Read the [SWAMP source diagnostic](../swamp-smoke/README.md) for the package
scope, current APK verification state, build command, and remaining renderer
limits.

Run the host assertions (including per-primitive source stream equivalence):

```powershell
python port/irrlicht-android/game/tests/run_prince_host.py `
  --assets port/android-native/app/src/main/assets
```

The test stages the checked APK-format asset tree and writes JSON evidence
below ignored `port/irrlicht-android/build/prince-character-host-checks/`; no
Android device is used.

## Provenance

The input ABI comes from `port/android-app/scene_buffers.hpp`. Its source data
is a bounded projection of checked BRES geometry and retains per-draw node,
geometry, material, and sampler identifiers. This module is new reconstruction
code; it does not claim to be part of DH2's recovered `glitch::` engine. It
uses the separate official Irrlicht OGL-ES branch import pinned at SVN r6038
(1.9.0 alpha) in `../upstream/`. The adapter and tests are outside that tree;
the upstream files remain covered by `../upstream-source-manifest.json`.

## Reproducible Android compile proof

From the repository root, with Android NDK r29 installed at the repository's
usual `work/emulator-test/sdk/ndk/29.0.14206865` path:

```powershell
python port/irrlicht-android/game/tests/compile_android.py
```

Set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` or `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` to override that location. The
script verifies the pinned header manifest, compiles this translation unit
for ARM64 and x86_64 Android API 26 against the r6038 headers, then links a
standalone shared library against each r6038 static archive. The generated
adapter libraries also receive 16 KiB `PT_LOAD` alignment checks. If Irrlicht
archives have not yet been built, run `python port/irrlicht-android/build.py
--no-apk` first. Objects, linked libraries, and the compile report are written
under ignored `game/build-compile/`. This command proves compile/link
compatibility; it does not run a renderer. The separate
[runtime smoke](../game-smoke/README.md) now exercises this adapter with a
synthetic pyramid on API 37/16 KiB, and the opt-in
[app-host diagnostic](../../android-app/IRRLICHT-HOST.md) does so on API
37/4 KiB. Those runtime fixtures are synthetic geometry, not imported DH2
assets. A separate cache-backed `void_maze` render is documented in the
[cache-scene smoke](../cache-scene-smoke/README.md); its texture/material
result verifies the `env_voidmaze.tga` mapping on its 30 referencing draws.
Full-scene composition and the other source materials and effect passes remain
unverified.

## Ownership and validation

`build_mesh` returns an `IMesh*` with its initial Irrlicht reference; the
caller releases it with `drop()`. The `SceneMesh` and its arrays remain
caller-owned and can be freed after the call. The adapter rejects absent
buffers, invalid capacities, non-finite vertex data, non-triangle index
counts, out-of-range draw spans, invalid texture spans, and indices that refer
outside their draw's own vertex span before allocating the Irrlicht mesh.
