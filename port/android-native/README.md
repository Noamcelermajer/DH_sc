# Native Android app

This project builds the current source reconstruction for Android. It is still
an incomplete development game; see the [project checklist](../../docs/PROJECT-CHECKLIST.md)
for verified systems and open work. The current debug APK is available from the
[GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/Noamcelermajer/DH_sc/releases/tag/native-combat-quest-tail-api37-2026-10-08).
That release builds ARM64 and x86_64, but this exact APK has not been live-tested.

## Build and install

Use Android Studio or install JDK 17+, Android SDK platform 37, NDK
`29.0.14206865`, and CMake `3.22.1`. Open this directory in Android Studio, or
run the Gradle wrapper here:

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug`. Configure the Android SDK
through Android Studio or an untracked `local.properties`. The APK is written
to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`; install it with:

```sh
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The app has minimum API 24 and targets API 37. The build packages ARM64 and
x86_64 native libraries. The selected assets needed by this build are tracked;
the complete original game cache is not bundled. To regenerate cache-derived
assets, use the original cache ZIP as a local input and follow the relevant
preparation instructions in [level-world](../level-world/README.md) and
[source availability](../../docs/SOURCE-AVAILABILITY.md).

## Verification and scope

Run focused host checks with the test runners in
[`port/game-data/tests`](../game-data/tests) and
[`port/level-world/tests`](../level-world/tests). Each module README identifies
its supported checks and evidence scope. `:app:assembleDebug` verifies Android
compilation and packaging; it does not establish live gameplay correctness.

The app currently provides a menu/character-selection path and a Crypt
development level with selected movement, animation, combat and loot behavior.
Enemy AI, full campaign progression, original camera and level lifecycle,
complete saves, and broad live gameplay remain unfinished. See the concise
[findings](../../docs/FINDINGS.md) and [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
