// Request subject/peer are Character identities for actor operations. Native
// adapters resolve the original embedded properties/CharAI/state-machine, not
// a replacement actor. For FX, subject=live VFX manager, peer=defender whose
// live orientation+16c is used, identity=borrowed target-position pointer,
// word0=FX key, word1/2=the two null stack arguments. read_property word0 is
// the source field ID; stun/fear words are duration/true/final bool; push words
// are push-bit/special; apply_dot words are duration/amount/element. All requests
// retain the mutable result and original attacker/defender identities. Virtual
// AI result providers resolve current CharAI and active AIS at their call phase.
// coop_player_count is the current Application+40 PlayerManager+6c4 field read,
// not a synthesized actor count or a query of a Game object. Its adapter
// must not introduce unrelated side effects. No owner yields a provider error.
//
// One owning thread retains all borrowed controls, actors, result and selected
// service backing through return. Aliases are rejected except attacker==defender;
// one Character identity must use one shared Actor projection, not two copies.
// Service bindings and argument identities are captured once. Actor scalars,
// mutable result and selected global singleton identities remain live; retired
// owners/returned positions/strings must survive every reached callback. Same
// actors/result/control reentry or destruction is forbidden; independent owners
// may nest. A service error/exception stops without rollback, invented cleanup,
// or later effect calls. Missing providers fail only when reached. In particular
// string destruction is not added during error unwinding. mode is the source
// bool word and is not consulted in the supported offline branch.
