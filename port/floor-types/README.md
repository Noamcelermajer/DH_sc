# Floor type properties

This host-only component parses the bounded `floortypes` UserProperties value
and reproduces the original floor masks used by navigation. `find_property`
requires a checked byte extent containing a NUL terminator, splits on LF and
the first `=`, trims ASCII whitespace around a key, decodes the first `%22...%22`
value pair, and uses the last occurrence of a duplicate key. A key-only line or
`key=` is present with an empty value; this is distinct from an absent key.
Parsing is capped at 64 KiB. Spans borrow the source bytes.

`floor_type_mask` uses the explicit property value whenever `floortypes` exists.
Only an absent key falls back to the node name. Matching is case-sensitive
substring matching and multiple tokens combine. The native masks are:

| Token | Mask | Meaning in the native floor record |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `hole` | `0x00000001` | Low path-eligibility requirement |
| `water` | `0x00000002` | Low path-eligibility requirement |
| `void` | `0x01000000` | Separate floor category flag |
| `wall` | `0x02000000` | Separate floor category flag |

`can_path_on` mirrors `PFObject::CanPathOn`: zero floor requirements are
always allowed; otherwise `(floor_mask & object_path_mask) == floor_mask`.
Void and wall remain distinct category flags and do not imply hole or water
path permissions.

## Reverse-engineering evidence

- `recovered/native/assembly/libDungeonHunter2.so/UserProperties-75e915465cf3-001.asm`:
  `_ParseKeyValue` at `0x318e5c`, `_ParseLine` at `0x318fe4`,
  `_ParseProperties` at `0x31903c`, and constructor at `0x319158`. The original
  splits LF lines, splits on the first `=`, and extracts the text between the
  first two `%22` markers when both exist.
- `recovered/native/assembly/libDungeonHunter2.so/PFFloor-ed6502919ecd-001.asm`:
  `_LoadNavMesh` at `0x520b40`; its case-sensitive substring checks OR the four
  masks above, and it consults the node name only if the `floortypes` property
  is absent.
- `recovered/native/assembly/libDungeonHunter2.so/PFObject-d3788b6ddde1-001.asm`:
  `CanPathOn` at `0x524230`; the floor mask must be a subset of the object's
  path mask, with a zero floor mask accepted.
- `recovered/native/assembly/libDungeonHunter2.so/PFWorld-c21c45a6e09d-001.asm`:
  `ValidatePosition` at `0x525d84` performs the path/floor query and invokes
  `CanPathOn`; subsequent world-position and collision handling remains outside
  this mask-only helper.
- The checked cache sample `cache/files/data/3d/modules/swamp/swamp.bdae` has
  `floortypes = %22hole%22` at BRES offset `0x94b18`, water at `0x94c6c`, wood
  at `0x95298`, and door at `0x9c6a8`. Cache files are supplied separately and
  are not copied into this source component.

Build and run focused host tests (the default cache path is the supplied local
cache next to the repository):

```sh
python port/floor-types/build.py
```

The strict host test binary is built under the system temporary directory and
removed after the run.
