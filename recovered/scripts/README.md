# Exact cache Lua source

The owner's complete cache contains **219 readable source scripts, 900,493
bytes**, under `data/scripts`. Their `.luac` extension does not identify their
actual encoding: none has a Lua bytecode signature or NUL bytes. All are text;
217 decode as UTF-8, and two contain single-byte non-UTF-8 characters. Original
bytes, filenames, comments and line endings are retained under `original/`.

The tree has 73 AI scripts, 128 skill scripts, 15 object scripts, two level
scripts and one test script. These are actual cache source, distinct from the
generated native pseudocode. They were not decompiled or rewritten. Each was
compared byte-for-byte with its member in the complete cache ZIP, SHA-256
`3fdf4e4c21d45a780a7c35fb4042abde0e88e76bf75416aad1f227481560b679`.
[The manifest](manifest.json) pins paths, members, sizes, encodings and hashes.

## Syntax and scope

Lua 5.1.5's [parse-only compiler option](https://www.lua.org/source/5.1/luac.c.html)
checks syntax without executing script code. **218 originals pass; one fails.**
The original `ai/sandworm_small_core.luac` line 159 lacks the outer closing
parenthesis in a `PlayAnim(GetPyOID(...))` call. A separate
[one-character source override](../../port/lua-scripts/README.md) passes syntax.
The original remains unchanged. [The validation report](../../reports/lua-source-validation.json)
records the compiler identity, per-file results and exact source/test hashes.

Syntax checks do not validate engine APIs, native object lifetimes, include
resolution, skill behavior, enemy behavior or gameplay. The original library
exports Lua 5.1-era APIs including `lua_getfenv` and `lua_setfenv`, and contains
a `Lua 5.1.4` copyright/version string. The syntax checker is explicitly Lua
5.1.5; these observations do not establish interpreter equivalence.
The native scripting bridge and a source-built game remain unfinished. These
files are not packaged into the current source preview APK.

The scripts retain the game's original rights status. This import does not
grant a game-wide open-source license; see [RIGHTS.md](../../RIGHTS.md).

```sh
python3 tools/verify_lua_source.py --cache /path/to/files --archive /path/to/cache.zip --compiler /usr/bin/luac5.1 --git-index --report /path/to/report.json
```

The archive/cache/compiler/index checks are optional. Hash verification of all
tracked original and override files always runs. The full-cache ZIP and generated
bytecode are not committed.

## Native bridge inventory

[The compiler-based inventory](../../reports/lua-global-bridge-audit.json)
counts 8,022 global reads and 1,103 global writes across all 219 selected
scripts, including nested function bodies. It uses the checked override for
the one malformed original. There are 317 distinct names read and 445 written.
Matching original native method names and Lua argument signatures identify
104 candidate bridge names. Registration and runtime behavior have not been
verified. A global read can refer to a value or a function; these counts are
not counts of calls or executed paths. Source-defined globals and Lua standard
library names are also present.

```sh
python3 tools/audit_lua_globals.py --compiler /usr/bin/luac5.1 --report /path/to/bridge-report.json
```

The tool checks source hashes and asks the compiler to list instructions
without executing scripts. The report pins compiler, manifest, symbol index
and tool hashes, with per-file global inventories and candidate method addresses.

[The separate original registration trace](../../reports/lua-registration-trace.json)
executes six original ARM32 registration caller bodies. It observes 568 Binder
boundary calls: 310 function registrations and 258 method registrations,
including inherited GameObject registrations repeated in derived classes.
There are 175 distinct function names; 117 names read by scripts match them.
It records exact names, callback targets, caller return addresses and contexts.
The base, math, table and string library initialization requests are observed.

Binder installation and standard library initialization are explicit stubs;
the original callback bodies and scripts are not executed. This verifies the
callers' registration arguments, not installation into a live Lua instance,
availability in every game context or callback behavior. The initial inventory
above remains a historical name/signature comparison with its original hash.

```sh
python3 tools/trace_lua_registrations.py --original /path/to/libDungeonHunter2.so --oracle port/skin-payloads/build/oracle.so --report /path/to/registration-report.json
```

The test needs Unicorn and pyelftools. It checks the original ELF identity and
pins caller body, symbol index, dependency oracle and test hashes. Six boundary
addresses are intercepted; inherited registration instructions run normally.
